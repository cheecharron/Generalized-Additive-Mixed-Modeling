# Generalized-Additive-Mixed-Modeling
Application of GAMM to Pre/Post Data

#GAMM
#Stepped-wedge design
#Robust sandwich standard errors

This code takes longitudinal data in which an intervention is introduced at some point (could be stepped-wedge design)
and depicts outcomes over time as a function of intervention (anchored at time point 0). Estimation of trajectories
was performed with robust sandwich standard errors to account for clustering due to repeated measurements.
